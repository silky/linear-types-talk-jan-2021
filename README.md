# linear-types-talk-jan-2021

Talk given at the [Cambridge NonDysFunctional Programmers
Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Cambridge-NonDysFunctional-Programmers/events/275549319/).

## Usage

Using stack, things "should just work":

```
stack build
```

I added the script `./build` to hide the verbose warnings [related to some strange issue
in stack itself](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/issues/5134).

## Talk

You can find the slides for the talk here: [./slides/talk.md](./slides/talk.md).

In order to run them, you could use
[patat](https://github.com/jaspervdj/patat/), However,  if you're on linux and
using konsole (like me) you'll need to use my hacked version of
[patat](https://github.com/silky/patat/tree/terrible-hack-that-i-feel-very-guilty-about)
so that the image of SPJ clears when you switch slides.
